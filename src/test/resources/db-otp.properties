# Sets the idleConnectionTestPeriod.  This sets the time (in minutes), for a connection
# to remain idle before sending a test query to the DB. This is useful to prevent a DB from timing out connections on its end.
# Do not use aggressive values here!   Default: 240 min, set to 0 to disable

# In order to reduce lock contention and thus improve performance, each incoming connection request picks off a connection
# from a pool that has thread-affinity, i.e. pool[threadId % partition_count].
# The higher this number, the better your performance will be for the case when you have plenty of short-lived threads.
# Beyond a certain threshold, maintenence of these pools will start to have a negative effect on performance
# (and only for the case when connections on a partition start running out).
bonecp.partitionCount=1

# Sets the maximum number of connections that will be contained in every partition.
# Setting this to 5 with 3 partitions means you will have 15 unique
# connections to the database. Note that the connection pool will not create all
# these connections in one go but rather start off with minConnectionsPerPartition and gradually
# increase connections as required.
bonecp.maxConnectionsPerPartition=4

# Sets the minimum number of connections that will be contained in every partition.

# When the available connections are about to run out, BoneCP will dynamically create new ones in batches.
